#Costs during a trip 
#this is an example exercise on Codeacademy which I really enjoyed doing (coz it is very practical in real life)


def hotel_cost(nights): 
  return 140*nights #140 is the cost of staying in hotel per night

def plane_ride_cost(city): #modify city names as you wish
  if city == "Charlotte":
    return 183 #cost of taking a plane to this destination
  elif city == "Tampa":
    return 220
  elif city == "Pittsburgh":
    return 222
  elif city == "Los Angeles":
    return 475   

def rental_car_cost(days): #cost of renting a car to travel in the city. You can change it to include daily/weekly transport tickets
  rent = 40 * days
  if days >= 7:
    rent -= 50
  elif days >= 3:
    rent -= 20
  return rent
  
 #total trip cost 
def trip_cost(city, days):
 return rental_car_cost(days) + hotel_cost(days - 1) + plane_ride_cost(city)
  
# we changed the argument of hotel_costs() from nights to days - 1 since we want trip_cost() to only depend on two parameters


#example data and their answers
print rental_car_cost(5) #180
print plane_ride_cost("Pittsburgh") #222
print hotel_cost(16) #2240
print trip_cost("Pittsburgh", 4) #782
